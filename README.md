# ODE-PDE-Notes

>The notes primarily cover initial value problems, boundary value problems, and Laplace transforms in ordinary differential equations; and elliptic equations, parabolic equations, and Sobolev spaces in partial differential equations. The ordinary differential equations section references Boye, DiPrima, and Meade's Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems, 11th Edition, John Wiley and Sons, 2017. The partial differential equations section is based on Evans' textbook. The latest update includes the fundamental concepts of ordinary differential equations. The notes also cover the necessary functional analysis foundations for partial differential equations, with references to Appendix D of Evans' textbook. Some of the extended material is derived from Brezis' textbook on functional analysis.
